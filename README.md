# Introduction

The name "Hexelate" is a wordplay combining the words "hexagon" and "pixelate". This is a small set of code (currently only in Matlab) that takes a digital image, samples its intensities in a hexagonal grid, and then draws colored dots of various sizes at the grid points to create a "downsampled(pixelated)" representation of the image. Alternatively, an image drawn with hexagons of different intensity/color can be created. 


# Background of this code

I wrote this code in 2022 to aid create a physical art work for my wife's birthday. I used a family portrait as the input and stamped dots of various sizes on a canvas using items like pens, a permanent marker and a coin. Thus the section of "instruction" which color-codes the different dot size.


# Credit

The part of the code that deals with hexagonal coordinate systems was adapted from codes created by [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons), who released their codes under a CC0 license. 
The artistic style of dot image was inspired by two artists as of 2022 residing in [Ateliers Ackersdijkstraat 20](http://ackersdijkstraat20.nl/), Rotterdam, Netherlands: [Michael Bom](http://michaelbom.com/) and Boris Pas.
